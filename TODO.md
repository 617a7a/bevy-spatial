- move EntityPoint<2D/3D> out of specific pacakges

- depend on linfa_nn? https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/blob/master/algorithms/linfa-nn/benches/nn.rs
- implement linear search versions

- implement https://github.com/InstantDomain/instant-distance

- benchmarks
- docs

- really want a cleaner way to do the plugins as they are all the same. making them generic doesn't seem too great tho.
